## 📖 About the Project

**griEnoy** is a **hands-on cybersecurity challenge platform** designed for learners to **practice troubleshooting and real-world scenarios safely**.

💡 **The problem it solves:**  
Most labs jump directly into **advanced tools (SIEM, malware analysis, etc.)**, leaving beginners with no safe way to practice the **basics** (users, groups, permissions, networking). This often creates a confidence gap.

✅ **How griEnoy helps:**
- Set up a VM once for safe practice
- Solve challenges with clear instructions & hints
- Immediate feedback: **Green ✅ for correct, Red ❌ to retry**
- Build confidence gradually: from **basics → advanced topics**

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Showcase my **cybersecurity skills** through practical challenges
- Build an **open-source learning hub** where anyone can contribute
- Help learners **practice without fear** before jumping into advanced tools
- Demonstrate my **portfolio project** for recruiters

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Docs:** Setup & troubleshooting guides

> ⚡ **Note:** I'm not a web developer. The UI was built with the help of AI + self-learning, but the **challenges and cybersecurity content are my own skills and knowledge**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Features

- 🏠 **Landing page** with Challenges, Docs, and Roadmap
- 🎮 **Challenges** by topic and difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- 📜 **Docs page** for setup & troubleshooting
- 🗺 **Roadmap** to guide learning progress
- ✅ **Answer validation** with success/failure feedback

---

## 🔑 Skills Demonstrated

- **Networking Fundamentals**
- **Windows & Linux Security**
- **User/Group & Permission Management**
- **Basic Cryptography**
- **SIEM & Log Analysis**
- **Malware Investigation**
- **Problem-solving & troubleshooting**

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Virtual Lab Setup Required

**🔴 CRITICAL WARNING - READ BEFORE STARTING CHALLENGES**

**griEnoy challenges MUST be practiced in isolated virtual machines. DO NOT skip this step!**

### 🛡️ **Why You NEED a Virtual Lab:**
- **Protects your main computer** from potential system damage
- **Safe environment** to practice potentially dangerous commands
- **Learn from scratch** - understand how systems work at the ground level
- **Real-world skill** - professionals always use isolated environments

### 💻 **Recommended Virtual Lab Setup:**
1. **Download virtualization software:**
   - [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (Free)
   - [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/) (Paid, more features)

2. **Create isolated VMs:**
   - **Windows VM:** Windows 10/11 (for Windows security challenges)
   - **Linux VM:** Ubuntu/Kali Linux (for Linux security challenges)
   - **Network VM:** pfSense or similar (for networking challenges)

3. **Configure safely:**
   - **Disable internet** for dangerous challenges
   - **Take snapshots** before each challenge
   - **Use host-only networking** when possible

### ⚡ **DANGER if you skip VM setup:**
- **💥 System corruption** - Some challenges modify critical system files
- **🔒 Account lockouts** - Permission challenges can lock you out
- **🌐 Network issues** - Networking challenges can break your connection
- **🦠 Malware exposure** - Advanced challenges involve analyzing malicious files
- **⚖️ Legal risks** - Tools could trigger security software alerts

**🎯 Bottom Line:** If you try to run challenges on your main system, you're asking for trouble!

**🚨 Additional Safety Guidelines:**
- 🔒 **Use a controlled lab environment** — disconnect from the internet for risky exercises
- 📚 **For learning & defense only** — do not misuse techniques
- ⚖️ **Stay legal** — only practice on systems you own or have explicit permission
